# pascal-lab-work ðŸ’¾

Just accidentally found my ancient laboratory work written (and incomplete)
in Pascal in the first or second year of my degree
at Moscow Institute of Radio Engineering, Electronics, and Automation (MIREA).

It uses `newt` for a widget-based user interface.
MS-DOS is not supported (but the professor didn't know about that ðŸ¤£).

There are some UI screenshots for examples:

![Splashscreen](doc/screenshots/01_splashscreen.png)
![Mainmenu](doc/screenshots/02_mainmenu.png)
![Create an address book](doc/screenshots/03_createbook.png)
![Create success](doc/screenshots/04_createbook_success.png)
![Create fail](doc/screenshots/05_createbook_fail.png)

Just found it funny ðŸ¤ª
